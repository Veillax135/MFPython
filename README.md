## What is this?
This is a collection/compilation of all of my python projects from the last year or two, as I learn and improve.

# Documentation on how to use is still WIP

## On startup:

The project will display system information that will clear 5 seconds after it is displayed, then it will output the following:

	Welcome to my Multi-Functional Python Application! Please choose one of the following options:
	Dice Roller(dice)
	Earth Circumfrence Calculator(ecc)
	If you would ever like to come back to this menu, please type 'Main Menu'
	
	<Current Time (Does not update)>
	
	Prompt: 
You may then proceed to input one of the loaded prompts, it will clear the screen, then load the requested project.
Please see the expanded documentation for full details on endpoints, avaliable options, and other changes that can be made for more functionality.
